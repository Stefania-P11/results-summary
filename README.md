## Overview

### The challenge

- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

## My process

### Built with

- HTML5
- CSS
- JavaScript
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- VS Code


### What I learned
 
 ...

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```
```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log('ðŸŽ‰')
}
```


### Continued development

I want to explore how to manipulate and pull data from json files instead of hardcoding it into the HTML file.
